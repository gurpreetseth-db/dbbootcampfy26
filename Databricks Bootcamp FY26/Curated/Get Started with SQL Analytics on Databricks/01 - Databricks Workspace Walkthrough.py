# MAGIC ## 9. Git Functionality (Optional)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The Databricks Workspace allows you to connect your projects with Git repositories. This enables you to collaborate on code, track changes, and easily sync your work between Databricks and Git. This demo will not provide any hands-on exercises with repos other than creating a Git Folder. However, we will go through the motions of using the UI together. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here's how to work with repos:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **📌 Note:** Before working with Repos user should have git credentials for resources and operations at the Databricks workspace level. Follow this <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/en/repos/repos-setup.html#set-up-databricks-repos" target="_blank">documentation</a> to set git credentials from **User settings**. [Databricks recommends Git folders over legacy Repos](https://docs.databricks.com/en/repos/what-happened-repos.html).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Add a Repo**:
# MAGIC    - Navigate to the **Workspace** from the sidebar.
# MAGIC    - In the **Workspace Home**, Click the **Create** button on the top right.
# MAGIC    - Select **Git folder** from the dropdown.
# MAGIC    - Paste the Git repo URL:  
# MAGIC    [https://github.com/databricks/databricks-ml-examples.git](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-ml-examples.git)
# MAGIC    - Click **Create**.
# MAGIC    - Navigate back to **Workspace** and click on Repos and find that a folder with your username has been created. Click on it. 
# MAGIC    - You will find the Git folder titles **databricks-ml-examples** has been created along with the folder for this course that starts with **get-started-with-databricks**. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Pull Changes**:
# MAGIC    - Inside a cloned Git folder, right-click on the folder name
# MAGIC    - Select **Git** option from the dropdown
# MAGIC    - Click on the **Pull** button at the top-right corner to update the repo with the latest changes.
# MAGIC    
# MAGIC * **Push Changes**:
# MAGIC    - Inside a cloned repo folder, click on the **Git** button.
# MAGIC    - Select the **branch** in which you want to push the changes.
# MAGIC    - Choose **Push** to send your local changes to the remote repository. Note that we haven't made any changes, so we cannot actually commit any code. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Commit Changes**:
# MAGIC    - Inside the cloned Git folder, click the Git button.
# MAGIC    - Select the **branch** where you want to make your changes
# MAGIC    - Enter the commit message
# MAGIC    - Choose **Commit** to save your changes along with the commit message. Note we will not follow through with this commit since we are only demonstrating the process.

# MAGIC ## Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we explored essential aspects of working with the workspace. We went through the workspace homepage, how to navigate the sidebar, how to navigate user settings, understanding how demos and labs will be set up using the classroom setup. We explored the workspace and navigation functionality, such as understanding how Git is integrated with Databricks. We explored how to work with notebooks and how to manage permissions with Unity Catalog. There is much more to discuss, but these are just the highlights of the Data Intelligence Platform.
