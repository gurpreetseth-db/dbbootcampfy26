# MAGIC ## AI/BI for Data Analysts
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to use the features Databricks provides for business intelligence needs: AI/BI Dashboards and AI/BI Genie. As a Databricks Data Analyst, you will be tasked with creating AI/BI Dashboards and AI/BI Genie Spaces within the platform, managing the access to these assets by stakeholders and necessary parties, and maintaining these assets as they are edited, refreshed, or decommissioned over the course of their lifespan. This course intends to instruct participants on how to design dashboards for business insights, share those with collaborators and stakeholders, and maintain those assets within the platform. Participants will also learn how to utilize AI/BI Genie Spaces to support self-service analytics through the creation and maintenance of these environments powered by the Databricks Data Intelligence Engine.
